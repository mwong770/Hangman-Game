* Users can click any key to play the game while listening to music
* Users can see values for wins, losses, number guesses left, and letters already guessed
* Users try to guess the letters to a word, using displayed spaceholders ('_') per letter as a clue
* Users have 9 tries to guess all the letters to a word
* Each time users guess a letter, correctly or not, it is displayed under 'Your Guesses So Far'
* If users guess a letter incorrectly, the swinging monkey falls to the ground 
* If users guess a letter correctly, the letter replaces the spaceholder and the 'Guesses Left' are reduced by 1 
* If the user runs out of guesses, losses are increased by 1 and the round is reset (spaces for a new word are displayed, 'Guesses So Far' is emptied, and 'Guesses Left' is changed back to 9)
* If the user guesses the entire word correctly, wins increase by 1 and the round is reset
* If users guess all 20 animal words correctly, a dancing bear is displayed, the round is reset, and users can click 'Replay' to play again
